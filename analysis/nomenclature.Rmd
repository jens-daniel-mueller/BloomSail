Throughout this analysis, the following naming conventions for objects (data sets) and variables are used.

# Nomenclature of objectes / data sets

The following names should be identical for stored files and objectes in R environment

- source
  - ts: tina 5 sensor
  - tb: tina 5 bottle
  - fm: finnmaid
  - og: ostergarnsholm tower
  - gt: GETM (high-res huydographical model)
  - mp: bathymetric map

- subsetting and modification levels
  - profiles vs surface: operation mode tina 5
  - ID: mean values for cruise (reduced temporal resolution)
  - daily: daily mean values
  - long: data stored in long format (all observations in only 2 columns "var" and "value")
  - fix: constant, unique values such as long-term means, starting dates, etc
  - iCT: includes cumulative numbers as iCT estimates
  - NCP: includes cumulative numbers as NCP estimates
  - CT_tem: data subset to analyse changes of CT with tem
  - 3d vs 2d: surface vs depth resolved GETM data
 
 
# Nomenclature of variables

- Descriptive variables
  - date
  - date_time
  - date_time_ID: mean date of cruise
  - date_time_ID_diff: time differences in between cruises
  - date_time_ID_ref: mean date in between cruises corresponding to observed incremental changes
  - station
  - ID: character identifying starting date of cruise as YYMMDD
  - dep: 1m depth intervals
  - lat
  - lon

- Observed variables: column names, or identifier in column "var" for long-format tables 
  - pCO2_analog: analog HydroC signal recorded on SeaBird CTD
  - pCO2_raw: HydroC signal recorded internally
  - pCO2_corr: HydroC signal recorded internally postprocessed by manufacturer
  - pCO2: Response time corrected pCO2_corr
  - sal
  - tem
  - nCT: CT calculated from pCO2, temperature, and fixed AT, S
  - CT: Measured dissolved inorganic carbon
  - AT: Measured total alkalinity
  - U10: wind speed at 10m
  - mld: mixed or mixing layer depth

- Variable name extension
  - mean
  - sd
  - min
  - max
  - int: interpolated value
  - grid: value gridded to a coarser resolution
  - diff: difference to previous value
  - diff_daily: difference to previous value divided by number of days
  - i: intergrated over depth
  - cum: cumulative value over time
  - sign: identifier for pos. or neg. differences

- p_XXX: ggplot object

# Chunk labeling

- criteria_: Definition of criteria for subsetting etc (should be at the beginning of each Rmd file)
- read_: read data
- calc_: perform calculations, mutate variables, etc
- chunks for plotting are labeled according to plot content, because name controls plot file name
