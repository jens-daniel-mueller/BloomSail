Throughout this analysis, the following naming conventions for objects (data sets) and variables are used.

# Nomenclature of objectes / data sets

The following names should be identical for stored files and objectes in R environment

- source
  - tx: data recorded on SV Tina V, where x stands for:
    - s: Sea-Bird SBE 16 sensor
    - h: Contros HydroC CO2
    - t: track data (coordinates + timestamp)
    - m: ts + th + tt merged (variables within tm are interpolated to a common time stamp)
    - b: TinaV discrete bottle
  - fm: finnmaid
  - og: ostergarnsholm tower
  - gt: GETM (high-res huydographical model)
  - mp: bathymetric map

- subsetting and modification levels
  - profiles vs surface: operation mode tina 5
  - ID: mean values for cruise (reduced temporal resolution)
  - daily: daily mean values
  - long: data stored in long format (all observations in only 2 columns "var" and "value")
  - fix: constant, unique values such as long-term means, starting dates, etc
  - iCT: includes cumulative numbers as iCT estimates
  - NCP: includes cumulative numbers as NCP estimates
  - CT_tem: data subset to analyse changes of CT with tem
  - 3d vs 2d: surface vs depth resolved GETM data
 
 
# Nomenclature of variables

- Descriptive variables
  - date
  - date_time
  - date_time_ID: mean date of cruise
  - date_time_ID_diff: time differences in between cruises
  - date_time_ID_ref: mean date in between cruises corresponding to observed incremental changes
  - station
  - ID: character identifying starting date of cruise as YYMMDD
  - dep: 1m depth intervals
  - lat
  - lon
  - deployment
  - Zero: Zeroing period of HydroC Sensor
  - Flush: Period following zero, reading recovers to ambient value (600sec)
  - mixing: Two phases of the Flush period (initial 20 sec for internal mixing)

- Observed variables: column names, or identifier in column "var" for long-format tables
  - pCO2: partial pressure of carbon dioxide, with following postfix indicating manipulation level 
    - _analog: analog HydroC signal recorded on SeaBird CTD
    - _raw: HydroC signal recorded internally
    - _corr: pCO2_raw postprocessed by manufacturer
    - _equi: pCO2_corr at the end of an in-water equilibration period at constant depth
    - _RT: Response time corrected pCO2_corr
    - _RT_mean: running mean of pCO2_RT
    - none: pCO2_RT_mean gridded to regular depth levels
  - sal
  - tem
  - nCT: CT normalized to AT, or calculated from pCO2, temperature, and fixed AT, S
  - CT: Measured dissolved inorganic carbon
  - AT: Measured total alkalinity
  - U10: wind speed at 10m
  - mld: mixed or mixing layer depth

- Variable name extension
  - mean
  - sd
  - min
  - max
  - int: interpolated value
  - grid: value gridded to a coarser resolution
  - diff: difference to previous value
  - diff_daily: difference to previous value divided by number of days
  - delta: offset from same parameter but estimated differently
  - i: intergrated over depth
  - cum: cumulative value over time
  - sign: identifier for pos. or neg. differences
  - rel: relative to some absolute value
  
Preset subsetting values are identified by postfix _lim and coded seperately

- p_XXX: ggplot object

# Chunk labeling

- criteria_: Definition of criteria for subsetting etc (should be at the beginning of each Rmd file)
- read_: read data
- calc_: perform calculations, mutate variables, etc
- chunks for plotting are labeled according to plot content, because name controls plot file name
