On this website we present our ongoing ambition to quantify net primary production during cyanobacteria blooms in the Baltic Sea through vertically resolved pCO~2~ measurements.

Please navigate trough the navbar on top to take a look at the various chapters of this project.

The links in the upper right corner bring you to the source code of this project and back to Jens' main homepage.
